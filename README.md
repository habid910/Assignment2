# Assignment2
Is a shopping app that offers particular items and the user can decide which one to choose.
The app consists of three pages: the main activity which welcomes the user to the store and then the user can click 
the button on the bottom to go to the menu page. The second page displays the items that are on sale and the user can 
decide which one to choose from.Also on the second page, the user can add/remove items. Depending on which button the user clicks, the price increases/decreases.Lastly, the third page which is a checkout page and it'll display a summary of the 
following: total items, subtotal, TPS, TVQ, and total with taxes.

The changes that were made to this assignment is that I made a recylcerview and I made one cardview. This made a big improvement to my assignment in terms of having less code. Because in the previous assignment I had a lot of repetitive code.
Unfortunately I wasn't able to implement most of the requirements. Such as sending the variables from the recyclerview to the checkout activity. Another thing wasn't implemented was the save states of the activity.
