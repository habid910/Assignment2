# Assignment1
Is a shopping app that offers particular items and the user can decide which one to choose.
The app consists of three pages: the main activity which welcomes the user to the store and then the user can click 
the button on the bottom to go to the menu page. The second page displays the items that are on sale and the user can 
decide which one to choose from.Also on the second page, the user can add/remove items. Depending on which button the user clicks, the price increases/decreases.Lastly, the third page which is a checkout page and it'll display a summary of the 
following: total items, subtotal, TPS, TVQ, and total with taxes.

For this assignment, I got inspired by the codelabs from the HelloToast assignment. Also I used stackoverflow for intent
 part in order to pass data through another activity.The other activity gets the result by using the getIntent.
Also you need a bundle to pass the data as well.

I also used code from a YouTube video for the onsavedinstancestate
And for the restore method as well.
